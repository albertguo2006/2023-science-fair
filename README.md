Vision Transformer Model Adapted from https://abhaygupta.dev/blog/vision-transformer

## SETUP
1. Download and unzip the project repositry

2. install requirements.txt using pip install requirements.txt and download associated project data from https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1o5EOIPZrV0NMiXwraPzFGiOISDY4ZiFU?usp=sharing

3. Unzip both nets.zip and datasets.zip and place into the project folder

## Usage
To test on pretrained nets, open test.ipynb, slected the dataset to be used and click the "run all cells" button at the top of the screen. This should appear as double triangle.

To train your own neural networks, open main.ipynb and select a dataset. Click "run all cells" as above. Results may differ from reported values due to dataset shuffling and varying parameters.

More extensive documentation will be made avalible at a later date.
